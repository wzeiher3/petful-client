The only thing we love more than Pets is queues! And we have a lot of them. This app will demonstarte some functionality of the Queue Stack Data Structure (Dogs, Cats, and People) and how it may apply to helping those seeking to adopt a pet.

All Data is stored and retrieved on server memory in a Linked List.

## How it works:

- Users first in line are only the ones able to adopt.
- Pets first in line are only the ones able to be adopted, either Cat, Dog, or Both.
- Add your name to the list and wait your turn until you are able to adopt a pet!
